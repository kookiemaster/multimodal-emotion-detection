# Model Selection: Hybrid Attention Networks (MER-HAN)

After thorough research and analysis of state-of-the-art multimodal emotion detection methods focusing on audio and text modalities, we have selected the **Hybrid Attention Networks (MER-HAN)** approach for implementation.

## Rationale for Selection

The Hybrid Attention Networks (MER-HAN) approach was selected based on the following criteria:

1. **Modality Compatibility**: MER-HAN is specifically designed for audio and text modalities, which aligns perfectly with our project requirements.

2. **Architecture Clarity**: The model has a well-structured three-stage architecture:
   - Audio and Text Encoder (ATE) with local intra-modal attention
   - Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) block for inter-modal feature learning
   - Multimodal Emotion Classification (MEC) block with global inter-modal attention

3. **Dataset Compatibility**: MER-HAN has been tested on the IEMOCAP dataset, which we have access to through the provided repository.

4. **Attention Mechanisms**: The model combines three different attention mechanisms to effectively capture both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships, which is crucial for multimodal emotion detection.

5. **Performance Potential**: Based on our analysis, MER-HAN appears to offer superior performance compared to other approaches by effectively addressing the challenge of multimodal fusion.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation of MER-HAN will involve the following components:

1. **Audio and Text Encoder (ATE)**:
   - For text: Implement a transformer-based encoder with local attention mechanism
   - For audio: Implement a deep learning model to extract audio features with local attention

2. **Cross-Modal Attention (CMA)**:
   - Implement cross-modal attention to capture relationships between audio and text features
   - Design the mechanism to learn different emotional interaction weights across modalities

3. **Multimodal Emotion Classification (MEC)**:
   - Implement global inter-modal attention mechanism
   - Design the final classification layer for emotion categories

## Technical Requirements

- PyTorch for deep learning implementation
- Transformers library for text processing
- Audio processing libraries (librosa, torchaudio)
- IEMOCAP dataset for training and evaluation

## Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Complex architecture implementation
   **Mitigation**: Break down the implementation into modular components and test each separately

2. **Challenge**: Computational resources for training
   **Mitigation**: Optimize batch sizes and consider gradient accumulation if needed

3. **Challenge**: Hyperparameter tuning
   **Mitigation**: Start with parameters reported in the paper and perform systematic tuning

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment with required dependencies
2. Prepare the IEMOCAP dataset for training
3. Implement the core components of the MER-HAN architecture
4. Train and evaluate the model
5. Optimize performance as needed
